| Lua | A [Sysdig](https://github.com/draios/sysdig)â€™s chisel (little script that analyzes and extracts useful informations from the sysdig event stream) capable of monitoring the processes currently executed on the machine. By executing the script it is possible to analyze at regular time intervals the execution time and the number of opened and closed sockets for one specified process (or for all the processes in execution). By monitoring the number and type of system calls executed we are able to measure the performance of an application, to check if the QoS requirements are satisfied (and if not why), and to analyze the amount of resources requested. | 

##SockClosePercPar - A tool to check unclosed socket FDs
SockClosePercPar is a Lua script that intercepts the ```socket``` system calls made by active processes (one in particular, or all of them) and for each process it checks if the relative file descriptors are eventually closed.

##Requirements
The following tools are required in order to use the script:
* Sysdig
* Lua 5.2

##Using the script
Open a terminal session and navigate to the script's directory. The script can be run with the following command:

	```sysdig -c SockClosePercPar.lua param```

The ```param``` parameter can be either ```all``` or the desired process' name.

<b>NOTE:</b> In order to run the script, you must have superuser privilegies.

##Results
SockClosePercPar outputs how many system calls (```socket``` or ```close```) were made by the process since the script's execution and during the last update interval, as well as the number of file descriptors closed after a ```socket``` syscall. Both ```socket``` and ```close``` are classified by type (```tcp```, ```udp```, other): every output column contains the whole number of ```socket``` or ```close``` and their subdivision between families. The script outputs new data every 7 seconds.
