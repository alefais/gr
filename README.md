| Lua | A [sysdig](https://github.com/draios/sysdig)â€™s chisel (little Lua script that analyzes the sysdig event stream to perform useful actions) capable of monitoring the processes currently executed on the machine. By executing the script it is possible to analyze at regular time intervals the execution time and the number of opened and closed sockets for one specified process (or for all the processes in execution). By monitoring the number and type of system calls executed we are able to measure the performance of an application, to analyze the amount of resources requested and to measure if it satisfies or not the quality of service requirements. |
